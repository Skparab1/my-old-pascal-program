# my-old-pascal-program
- A program that I had made for a computer programming contest in Pascal in 7th grade (and I won 2nd place in my grade)
- However, when I found it, it was turned into a .exe format file, and I was unable to open it. I tried on a windows device and vscode was able to open and run the file, but the code was encoded into a bunch of question marks and weird characters.
